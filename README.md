# sphinx-aimms-theme

This Sphinx theme was designed to provide a great reader experience for documentation users on both desktop and mobile devices for AIMMS projects.

This theme is inherited from the great [Read the Docs](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) but can work with any Sphinx project. 

You can find a working demo of the theme on AIMMS documentation websites:
- [How-to](https://how-to.aimms.com)
- [Documentation](https://documentation.aimms.com)

Installation
===============

This theme is distributed on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

`pip install sphinx-aimms-theme`

To use the theme in your Sphinx project, you will need to add the following to your conf.py file:

``` python
extensions = [
    ...
    "sphinx_aimms_theme",
]

html_theme = "sphinx_aimms_theme"
```

Configuration
================

Theme options
----------------

The following options can be defined in your projectâ€™s conf.py file, using the html_theme_options configuration option.

For example:

``` python
html_theme_options = {
    'doc_title': 'Title of my docs',
    'home_page_description': 'my meta description',
}
```

**doc_title**

Title you will see on the top left corner of your docs

**home_page_description**

Description that will appear in the html meta description of your home page



This theme is highly customizable on both the page level and on a global level. See https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html
